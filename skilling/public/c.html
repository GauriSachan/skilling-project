    <h2>üí° Why We Built SkillSaarthi</h2>
    <p>
      The idea for SkillSaarthi was born from a deeply felt need. We looked around and saw young people ‚Äî talented, hungry to learn, full of potential ‚Äî yet stuck. Stuck due to a system that often favors rote learning over real skill. Stuck because of language barriers. Stuck because of poor internet access, or the lack of a mentor.
    </p>

    <p>
      We knew that the solutions existed. Open-source tools, artificial intelligence, mentorship networks ‚Äî all the building blocks were already out there. What was missing was a bridge to connect them to the people who needed them most.
    </p>

    <h2>üõ† Built By Students, For Students</h2>
    <p>
      We are students, engineers, mentors, and dreamers. And we built SkillSaarthi because we wish we had it when we started. It's designed not by corporate minds, but by real learners who‚Äôve faced the same challenges ‚Äî and decided to do something about it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every page you visit here is crafted with empathy, every feature built to remove a barrier, every corner filled with the hope that we can shape a future where no one gets left behind.
    </p>

    <h2>‚öôÔ∏è A Platform With Purpose</h2>
    <p>
      This is more than a website. It‚Äôs a growing ecosystem. A launchpad. A space where skills meet opportunity, where mentorship becomes a chain reaction, and where every learner becomes a teacher in time.
    </p>

    <p>
      SkillSaarthi is our small step toward a big dream: <span class="highlight">a skilled, confident, and empowered India.</span>
